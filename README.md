# Covid19-Data-analysis

üìå In this project, I collected reliable COVID-19 datasets from trusted sources and performed an in-depth analysis to gain insights into the pandemic. Here's how I approached it:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection: Gathered relevant COVID-19 datasets from government health departments and trusted data repositories.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed the data, handling missing values and ensuring suitable formats for analysis.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to explore and visualize the data, uncovering trends and patterns.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering: Created new features and derived meaningful metrics to enhance the analysis, such as daily new cases and growth rates.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to identify correlations, perform hypothesis testing, and discover significant factors related to COVID-19 spread.
# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Project
The COVID-19 Data Analysis GitHub repository is a comprehensive collection of analyses and visualizations related to the global COVID-19 pandemic. It includes Jupyter Notebooks that showcase the step-by-step analysis process, curated datasets, and scripts for data preprocessing and visualization.The repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in understanding the spread and impact of COVID-19. It offers data-driven insights, facilitates further exploration of the pandemic, and supports evidence-based decision-making in mitigating its effects on public health.
